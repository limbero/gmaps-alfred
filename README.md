# Google Maps directions script

This little script will give you directions via your preferred means of transportation from point a point b, using Google Maps in your default browser.

Syntax:

```
./directions.py "bike from Battery Park to Madison Square Garden"
```

or more generally:

```
./directions.py "[mode] from [origin] to [destination]"
```

I built this for use with alfred, but you can use it for anything.

Supported modes of transportation: bike, drive, transit, walk.
